- Data hiding using steganography principles.
- Support for multiple file formats (e.g., images, audio).
- Web-based interface for user interaction.
- Secure encoding and decoding techniques.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using:

- **Python** (39.8%): Backend logic for encoding and decoding data.
- **HTML** (33.7%): Structuring the web interface.
- **CSS** (23%): Styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript** (3.5%): Adding interactivity to the frontend.
